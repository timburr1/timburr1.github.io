## About Me  
Hello, my name is Tim! I'm an educator and full-stack software developer based in the US Mountain West. I'm on [GitHub](https://github.com/timburr1) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-burr-a39a8866), or you can email me at the reverse of moc.liamg@rrub.r.mit. I love to read, travel, get outdoors, and play all sorts of games with my friends and my beautiful wife. Fun fact: I donated bone marrow several years ago, so now there is a ~~small child~~ young lady in Nevada whose immune system is 87% my immune system. Weird.

## About This Site  
This blog is meant to be a sort of scratchpad or [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book), to record things that I want to remember or share later. It was mostly written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and compiled with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The source code is available [here](https://github.com/timburr1/timburr1.github.io), and it's obviously hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
