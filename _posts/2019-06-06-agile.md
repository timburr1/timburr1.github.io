## Agile Values  
Individuals and interactions >> processes and tools  
Working software >> comprehensive documentation  
Customer collaboration >> contract negotiation  
Responding to change >> following a plan  

## Agile Principles 
Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software  
Welcome changing requirements, even in late development  
Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)  
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers  
Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted  
Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)  
Working software is the primary measure of progress  
Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace  
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design  
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential  
Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams  
Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
