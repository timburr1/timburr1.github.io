To install RetroPie, follow the instructions in the [RetroPie Beginner's Guide](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/First-Installation/)  
Download + install the Raspberry Pi Imager:  
* [Windows installer](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)
* Mint Linux: ```sudo snap install rpi-imager
```  

Run the imager from your start menu, and use it to write the OS **RetroPie 4.7.1 (RPI 2/3)** to your MicroSD card, example [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/540857/107868009-493a6400-6e4e-11eb-9272-7f45d569dc44.gif)  
Once it's written, eject the MicroSD card from your computer and install it into the Raspberry Pi  
Transfer some ROMs, according to the instructions [here](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Transferring-Roms/)
