[Foundations of Information Security: A Straightforward Introduction](https://nostarch.com/foundationsinfosec) - Jason Andress

### [1. Introduction](/papers/CYB110/Module 1 - Introduction.pptx)
McCumber Cybersecurity Model: Protect information in transmission, in storage, while processing. Includes technology, policies & practices, and education.

Information Security Triad:
* Confidentiality  
* Integrity  
* Availability  

Risk Management Process:
1. Identify Assets
2. Identify Threats
3. Assess Vulnerabilities
4. Assess Risks
5. Mitigate Risks

### [2. Identification and Authentication](/papers/CYB110/Module 2 - Identification and Authentication.pptx)
Need to verify identities, so that we can ensure that only authorized users can see or modify data.

ID factors:
* What you know:  password, PIN, answer to secret question
* What you have: ATM card, cell phone, smart token
* What you are: biometrics (more on this later)
* What you do: keystroke patterns, voice patterns, signature recognition
* Where you are: at a specific location, using a specific device (trusted path)

### [3. Authorization and Access Control](/papers/CYB110/Module 3 - Authorization and Access Control.pptx)
Controlled access: which subjects (human users) have access (read/write/execute) to which objects (files, directories)?

Windows access control lists vs. Linux chmod

Rule-based vs. role-based access control

Multilevel security models:
* Bell-LaPadula (BLP) Model (most influential)
* Biba Integrity Model
* Brewer and Nash model (Chinese Wall Model)

### [4. Auditing Accountability](/papers/CYB110/Module 4 - Auditing Accountability.pptx)
Accountability: All actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to that entity. I.e. keeping accurate records of who did what and when they did it.

Auditing: the (periodic) process of reviewing an organization’s records or information.

### [5. Cryptography](/papers/CYB110/Module 5 - Cryptography.pptx)
Cryptography: The discipline that embodies the principles, means, and methods for the transformation of data in order to hide their semantic content, prevent their unauthorized use, or prevent their undetected modification. 

Cryptographic system: Associated information assurance items interacting to provide a single means of encryption or decryption. 

Plaintext: Data input to the Cipher or output from the Inverse Cipher. 

Ciphertext: Data output from the Cipher or input to the Inverse Cipher. 

Cipher: Any cryptographic system in which arbitrary symbols or groups of symbols, represent units of plain text, or in which units of plaintext are rearranged, or both. 

Encryption (encode, encipher): Conversion of plaintext to ciphertext through the use of a cryptographic algorithm. 

Decryption (decode, decipher): Conversion of ciphertext to plaintext through the use of a cryptographic algorithm. 

Cryptology: The science that deals with hidden, disguised, or encrypted communications. It includes communications security and communications intelligence. 

Cryptanalysis: The study of mathematical techniques for attempting to improve or defeat cryptographic techniques and information-system security. This includes the process of looking for errors or weaknesses in the implementation of an algorithm or in the algorithm itself.

Block vs. stream ciphers

Asymmetric vs. symmetric-key cryptography

Diffie-Helman key exchange

### [6. Compliance](/papers/CYB110/Module 6 - Compliance.pptx)
Compliance: satisfying the requirements of laws, regulations or contracts.

Can be internally (source code, trade secrets) or externally (HIPAA, FERPA, GDPR) defined

Controls: physical, administrative, or technical; key vs. compensating controls

### [7. Operations Security](/papers/CYB110/Module 7 - Operations Security.pptx)
Holistic approach to Operation Security:
1. Identify critical information. can be internally defined (source code, trade secret, etc.) or external (HIPAA, FERPA, GDPR, etc.)  
2. Threat analysis  
3. Vulnerability analysis  
4. Risk assessment  
5. Apply countermeasures  

Laws of OpSec:
1. Know the threats  
2. Know what to protect  
3. Protect the information  

### [8. Human Security](/papers/CYB110/Module 8 - Human Security.pptx)
Password attacks: brute-force vs. dictionary attacks

Social engineering: phishing, spam, pretexting, tailgating, shoulder-surfing

### [9. Physical Security](/papers/CYB110/Module 9 - Physical Security.pptx)
Protect the data by protecting people, equipment, and facilities.

Major sources of physical threats:
* Extreme temperature - extreme heat or cold
* Gases – includes humidity or dry air, gases, suspended particles
* Liquids – includes water, chemicals
* Living organisms – viruses, bacteria, animals, insects
* Projectiles -- powered objects
* Movement – shaking, collapse, slide, vibrating
* Energy anomalies - electrical surge, static electricity, radiation
* People
* Toxins
* Smoke and fire

Physical security controls:
* Deterrent controls - discourage people from violating the security controls.
* Detective controls - sense and report undesirable events.
* Preventive controls - physical means to keep unauthorized entities from breaching your physical security.

### [10. Network Security](/papers/CYB110/Module 10 - Network Security.pptx)
ISO/OSI Reference Model - Provides a common basis for coordination of standards. Based on a hierarchical model:  
* Application Layer
* Presentation Layer
* Session Layer
* Transport Layer
* Network Layer
* Data Link Layer
* Physical Layer

Network attacks:
* Distributed denial of service
* Port scanning
* Interception
* Replay
* Spoofing/Masquerading
* Hijacking

Mitigation: 
* Remove non-essential services
* See netstat
* Keep systems updated
* Use a firewall: 
** Packet filtering 
** Stateful packet inspection
** Deep packet inspection
* Use a Proxy
* Use a DMZ
* Install Intrusion Detection System
* Use a VPN

### [11. Operating System Security](/papers/CYB110/Module 11 - Operating System Security.pptx)
Operating System: mediates between user/applications and computer hardware; manages resources and permissions.

OS Hardening: 
* Remove unnecessary software
* Remove unneeded services
* Alter or remove default accounts
* Use principles of least privilege
* Update software
* Implement logging and auditing

8. Least astonishment

[Saltzer & Schroeder, 1975](http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/index.html)  

[Saltzer & Kaashoek, 2009](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-004-principles-of-computer-system-design-an-introduction-spring-2009/online-textbook/part_ii_open_5_0.pdf)

Avoiding the Top 10 Software Security Design Flaws:
1. Use an authentication mechanism that cannot be bypassed or tampered with
2. Authorize after you authenticate
3. External components change the attack surface
4. Earn or give, but never assume trust
5. Define an approach that ensures all inputs/data are explicitly validated
6. Strictly separate data and control instructions, and never process control instructions from untrusted sources
7. Identify sensitive data and how they should be handled
8. Use cryptography correctly
9. Always consider users
10. Be flexible when considering future changes to objects and actors

[IEEE Center for Secure Design](/papers/CYB110/CybersecurityInitiative-online.pdf)

Secure coding 
* A style of programming that prevents abnormal termination or unexpected actions.
* Handles bad input gracefully
* Detects internal errors and handles them gracefully.

Defensive programming  
* What could someone deliberately do to compromise your program?
* What could someone unintentionally do to compromise your program?

Buffer overflow + integer overflow attacks

Code auditing: code comprehension vs. candidate point strategies

Static code analysis with flawfinder

Fuzzing
