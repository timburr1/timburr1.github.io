[Key Terminology Cheat Sheet](/papers/anthropic/AI_Fluency_vocabulary_cheat_sheet.pdf) 

## The 4D Framework:
* Delegation: Thoughtfully deciding what work to do with AI vs. doing yourself
* Description: Communicating clearly with AI systems
* Discernment: Evaluating AI outputs and behavior with a critical eye
* Diligence: Ensuring you interact with AI responsibly

### Delegation
* Problem Awareness: Understanding your goals and the work involved to achieve it
* Platform Awareness: Knowing what different AI systems can do
* Task Delegation: Strategically dividing work between you and AI

### Description
* Product Description: Clearly defining what you want the AI to create
* Process Description: Guiding how the AI approaches your request
* Performance Description: Defining how you want the AI to behave during your collaboration.

### Discernment
* Product Discernment: Evaluating the quality of AI outputs
* Process Discernment: Assessing how the AI approached the task
* Performance Discernment: Evaluating how the AI behaved during the interaction itself

The Description-Discernment Loop

### Diligence
* Creation Diligence: Being thoughtful about which AI systems you choose and how you work with them
* Transparency Diligence: Being open about AI's role in your work
* Deployment Diligence: Taking ownership for AI-assisted outputs you share with others
