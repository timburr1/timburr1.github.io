## Setup
[Visual Studio 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes) (Community Edition is fine. My understanding is that VS 2022 will also work, but installing MonoGame involves jumping through extra hoops. Also, Microsoft has promised to support the 2019 version until 2029.)
