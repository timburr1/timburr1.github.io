I made a Discord bot recently, just to see how it works. Troll 9000 is pretty simple, it just reacts to any of my messages with a ðŸ‘‘, and my friends' with a ðŸ’©. (If you want to check out this masterpiece, the source code is available [here](https://github.com/timburr1/troll9000).) To make your own and add it to a server, follow the instructions in this [Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide/). 

You can set up a Node.js server in [replit](https://replit.com/), even from a school computer. (Replit can talk to the Discord API, so if your bot is running there you can test it in real time.) Start with this [**Example Project**](https://github.com/timburr1/discord-bot-template).
