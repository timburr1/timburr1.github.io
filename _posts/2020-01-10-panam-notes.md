I recently finished a fake travel web site for Spanish learners. You can <del>look at it [here](https://panam.azurewebsites.net), or</del> check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/timburr1/panam).  

It was built with React, based on Brian Holt's [Complete Intro to React v5](https://github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v5) course for [FrontEndMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/). This was overkill, but I needed to learn React for work.  

To run it locally, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) installed.  

Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code or PowerShell; cd into the project root; run 'npm run dev'; point a web browser at [localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/)  

Some helpful VSCode extensions:  
* Azure App Service  
* ESLint  
* npm Intellisense  
* Prettier (File -> Preferences -> Settings, enable 'Format on Save' and 'Prettier: Require Config')  

Other useful resources:  
* [Azure Fundamentals Learning Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/)  
* [Quickstart: Create a Node.js web app in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-nodejs)  
* [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) with React  
* MDN: [Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)  
* [CI/CD with Github](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment)  

[react-datepicker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datepicker) is cool.
