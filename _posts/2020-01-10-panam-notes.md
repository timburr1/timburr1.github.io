I recently finished a fake travel web site. You can look at it [here](https://panamerica.azurewebsites.net/), or check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/timburr1/panam).  

It was built with React, based on Brian Holt's [Complete Intro to React v5](https://github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v5) course for [FrontEndMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/). This was overkill, but I needed to learn React for work.  

To run it, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) installed.  

Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code or PowerShell; cd into the project root; and run 'npm run dev'.  

Some helpful VSCode extensions:  
* ESLint  
* npm Intellisense  
* Azure App Service  
* Prettier (File -> Preferences -> Settings, enable 'Format on Save' and 'Prettier: Require Config')
