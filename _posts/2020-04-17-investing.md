**This is not real financial advice. I have no fiduciary duty toward you, whoever you are. Past results are not indicative of future returns. Proceed at your own risk.**  

I subscribe to a fairly strong version of the [Efficient Markets Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis): it's unlikely for you as a retail investor to beat the market. It's not impossible, and in particular you can do well investing in sectors and companies that you know a lot about, but most people will lose money, relative to the benchmark, most of the time. See Malkiel: [A Random Walk down Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street) for a good book-length treatment of this idea.

So what should you invest in? A combination of index funds including U.S. stocks, internation stocks, and bonds has done well historically. Pick a target allocation based on your risk/reward goals, and rebalance periodically. See [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Bogleheads-Guide-Investing-Taylor-Larimore/dp/0470067365) for more details. We live in a golden age of passive investing, with [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/home) and [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/) (among others) offering very cheap stock and bond ETFs to track whatever index you care about.  

If you still want to pick individual stocks, [The Intelligent Investor](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661) by Benjamin Graham is the classic book on security valuation, but kind of dated. This is also kind of a golden age for retail stock investors, with more and more brokerages offering free trades and fractional shares. More info:
