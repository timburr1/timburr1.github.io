Hopefully you are already using a password manager to keep a separate (long, complex, unique) password for each website you use, updating your software regularly, and not clicking sketchy links on the internet. Another thing you can do[^1] to defeat identity thieves is to freeze your credit. This tells the credit bureaus not to release your credit report to anyone who doesn't already have access. Since most lenders wonâ€™t issue credit without first checking your report, freezing it prevents new accounts from being opened in your name. A credit freeze is free and fairly straightforward, but you need to do it separately with each of the big three consumer credit reporting agencies:

* [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/)
* [Experian](https://www.experian.com/)
* [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com/)

You don't need to upgrade to a paid CreditLock or whatever, just search for "credit freeze." You will need:

* Your full legal name
* Date of birth
* Social Security number
* Current and past addresses
* Access to your phone/email for identity verification

Each bureau will give you a PIN or account to manage freezes/unfreezes. Store these in your password manager.

Also, remember that you may need to temporarily unfreeze one or more of the above if you are:

* Applying for a mortgage or car loan
* Opening a new credit card
* Switching phone providers
* Getting a background check for a job

Unfreezing can be done online, often within minutes, and you can lift the freeze for a only a set period of time.
