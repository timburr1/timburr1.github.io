title: Freeze Your Credit
excerpt: Hopefully you are already using a password manager to keep a separate (long, complex, unique) password for each website you use, updating your software regularly, and not clicking sketchy links on the internet. Another thing you can do to defeat identity thieves is to freeze your credit.

Hopefully you are already using a password manager to keep a separate (long, complex, unique) password for each website you use, updating your software regularly, and not clicking sketchy links on the internet. Another thing you can do[^1] to defeat identity thieves is to freeze your credit. This is free and fairly straightforward, but you need to do it separately with each of the big three credit rating agencies:

* [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/)
* [Experian](https://www.experian.com/)
* [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com/)

You don't need to upgrade to a paid CreditLock or whatever, just search for "credit freeze." Also, remember that you may need to temporarily unfreeze one or more of the above if you apply for a house or car loan, or get a new job.
