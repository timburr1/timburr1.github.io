[Magic: the Gathering Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena) is the new hotness from Wizards. It's had the best interface for a while, and WotC recently added the Cube and the ability to draft against other humans. This is the way to play limited online in 2020.  

For constructed, [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/) is decent, free (as in proxies), and supports multiplayer. It's a little trickier to get running though:    
* Install [cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/) and run the Oracle tool.
* Build or import a deck. This part is pretty slick: you can build a deck by hand or export a text file like [Omnath](/_ref/magic/rg omnath.txt), [Prossh](/_ref/magic/prossh.txt), or [the Ur-Dragon](/_ref/magic/ur-dragon.txt) from [TappedOut](https://tappedout.net/) or [DeckBox](https://deckbox.org/). Import the text file and Save-As *.cod.
* Menu: Cockatrice -> Register to server... 
* Create an account, and consider supporting [Rooster Ranges](https://cockatrice.us/index.php).
* Menu: Cockatrice -> Connect
* Create or join a game.  

The [Cockatrice Discord](https://discord.gg/3Z9yzmA) is a good place to find people to play with.
