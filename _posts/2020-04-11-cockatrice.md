[Magic: the Gathering Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena) is the new hotness from Wizards. With the best interface and the Cube, this is the way to play limited online in 2020.

For constructed, [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/) is decent, free (as in proxies), and supports multiplayer.  
* Install cockatrice and run the Oracle tool.
* Build or import a deck. This part is pretty slick: you can build a deck by hand or export a text file like [Omnath](../../../_ref/rg omnath.txt), [Prossh](../../../_ref/prossh.txt), or [the Ur-Dragon](../../../_ref/ur-dragon.txt) from [TappedOut](https://tappedout.net/) or [DeckBox](https://deckbox.org/). Import the text file and Save-As *.cod.
* Menu: Cockatrice -> Register to server... 
* Create an account, and consider supporting [Rooster Ranges](https://cockatrice.us/index.php).
* Menu: Cockatrice -> Connect
* Create or join a game.
