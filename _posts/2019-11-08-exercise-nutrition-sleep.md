## Exercise

### Free Weights
Pick a program that you like, and that works for your goals; I am currently using a modified version of [5/3/1 for Beginners](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/5-3-1-for-beginners/). More programming resources:

### Kettlebells  
From the [/r/kettlebell FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/3qxa4i/new_to_kettlebells_start_here_updated_for_2015/):

> The general recommendation is to start with 35 lbs (16 kg) if you are a guy, and 18-20 lbs (8-9 kg) if you are a girl. Unscientifically, I'd guess that these weights are appropriate for 90% of the population. 
>
> **Simple and Sinister** is the same workout every day, 5-6 days/week: 
> * Warmup  
> * 5 sets of 10 two-hand swings.  
> * 10 Turkish Get-ups (5 per side).  
>
> As you get stronger, move from 5 sets of ten 2-handed swings to 10 sets of ten 2-handed swings (a total of 100).  
>
> Then slowly replace sets with alternating sets of 1-handed swings until you are doing 100 reps of 1-handed swings with perfect form. 
>
> Gradually reduce rest until you can complete 100 reps of 1-handed swings with perfect form in 5 minutes. (Because 10 swings should take you about 15 seconds, this should work out to a 1:1 work:rest ratio, alternating 15 seconds of swings and 15 seconds of rest, for five minutes.) 
>
> Do TGUs slowly, focusing on form. Eventually, you'll become strong enough to take 10 minutes to do your 10 reps (5 per side), maintaining a roughly 1:1 work:rest ratio (alternating 30 seconds of work and 30 seconds of rest for 10 minutes). 
>
> So, ultimately you will progress to: 
> * Warmup  
> * 10 sets of 10 one-hand swings (5 sets per hand) in 5 minutes.  
> * 10 slow Turkish Get-ups (5 per side) in 10 minutes, keeping a work:rest ratio of 1:1.

## Nutrition
*"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." -Michael Pollan*  

As long as your total calories and protein are reasonable, and your diet doesn't contain too much processed junk, you are probably fine. Athletes should shoot for about 0.8-1g of high-quality protein per pound of bodyweight, per day. Eat 2-3g of creatine monohydrate per day, ideally after workouts. Timing isn't too important, but be careful about mixing it with caffeine; this causes GI discomfort for many people.

[Evidence that protein requirements have been
significantly underestimated](/papers/elango2010.pdf) - Elango et al, 2010 (PDF)  
> The indicator amino acid oxidation-based requirement values of 0.93 and 1.2g protein/ kg/day and the reanalysis of existing nitrogen balance studies are significantly higher than current recommendations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reassess recommendations for protein intake in adult humans.  

[Not Another Boring Creatine Guide: Answers to FAQs and Lesser-Known Benefits](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/creatine/) - Eric Trexler, StrongerByScience  
> Phosphocreatine provides rapid ATP replenishment, but a muscle can only store so much creatine and phosphocreatine at a given time. In this sense, creatine can be thought of as a quantitatively limited, but fairly instantaneous, reservoir for the replenishment of ATP. The purpose of creatine supplementation is to increase the amount of stored creatine, thereby bolstering the capacity of this rapid ATP-generating energy system. In addition, creatine has been shown to increase lean body mass, presumably due to increased intramuscular fluid retention and improved resistance training capacity.

[Perfecting Protein Intake for Athletes: How Much, What, and When? (and Beyond)](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/athlete-protein-intake/) - Jorn Trommelen, StrongerByScience  
> Eat at least four meals with at least 40g of protein, spread them out throughout the day (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner, and pre-sleep), and get the majority of that protein from animal-based sources. In addition, ingest 5g of supplemental leucine before your meals or during your meal (best and second best option, respectively). If supplemental leucine is no option, a whey protein or hydrolyzed protein shake could be used a replacement (third best option).  

[Reflecting on Five Years Studying Protein](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/reflecting-on-five-years-studying-protein/) - Eric Helms, StrongerByScience  
> Well, based on everything, I think ~0.8-1g/lb (~1.8-2.2g/kg) is probably the highest intake you’ll benefit from in terms of enhancing strength or mass gains when you’re not in a deficit. Higher intakes are fine, but the only benefit would be for people who tend to overeat in the offseason and want to limit their calorie consumption to prevent excess fat gain.

[The Three Laws of Protein](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-three-laws-of-protein/) - Greg Nuckols, StrongerByScience  
> Get somewhere in the neighborhood of 1g/lb or 2g/kg of protein per day, space your intake out rather than concentrating it all in one period, and prioritize protein sources like whey, meat, and eggs.  

## Sleep
It's really important to get enough sleep; most adults need 7-9 hours per night. Pick a regular bedtime based on when you need to get up, and stick to it. Exercise regularly and use a program like [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) to block blue light for an hour or so before bed, or even better: get off of your phone/computer altogether.
