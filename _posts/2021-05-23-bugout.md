Recent events have highlighted the need to be prepared in case of emergencies. You definitely don't need to build a bunker, or stockpile weapons and MREs, but keeping food, water, and supplies on hand is easy and worthwhile. You should be able to hole up and keep yourself alive for a few days, or be ready to leave home on a few hours' notice. This latter is easier if you already have most of what you need in a bugout bag:
