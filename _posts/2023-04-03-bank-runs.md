[Banking in very uncertain times - Patrick McKenzie, Bits about Money](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/banking-in-very-uncertain-times/)
> The thing killing banks is a very simple idea with profound consequences. It is not a secret: when interest rates rise, all asset prices must fall. This is both almost a law of nature and also perpetually underestimated in how much it affects the world outside of asset prices.

[The Demise of Silicon Valley Bank - Marc Rubinstein, Substack](https://www.netinterest.co/p/the-demise-of-silicon-valley-bank/)
> The problem at Silicon Valley Bank is compounded by its relatively concentrated customer base. In its niche, its customers all know each other. And Silicon Valley Bank doesn’t have that many of them. As at the end of 2022, it had 37,466 deposit customers, each holding in excess of $250,000 per account. Great for referrals when business is booming, such concentration can magnify a feedback loop when conditions reverse.

[The End of Silicon Valley (Bank) - Ben Thompson, Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/2023/the-death-of-silicon-valley-bank/)
> There are certain complexities about what happened to Silicon Valley Bank last week... At the end of the day, though, the mechanics were pretty simple:
> 1. Silicon Valley Bank’s depositors, many of whom were startups, deposited the cash they received from investors; the amount of deposits was particularly high over the last few years thanks to the ocean of money unleashed during COVID, much of which found its way to the tech sector.
> 2. Silicon Valley Bank effectively lent a large portion of that money to the federal government (in the form of U.S. Treasuries) and home owners (in the form of agency mortgage-backed securities). While Silicon Valley Bank used to primarily lend out money on shorter-term durations, in 2021 the bank shifted to longer-term securities in search of more yield; this, in retrospect, was the critical mistake — and to be clear, Silicon Valley Bank’s management bears ultimate culpability for the bank’s fate.
> 3. When interest rates rose, (1) fewer deposits came in as venture capital funding dried up and (2) the market value of those securities plummeted: who would want to buy a 10 year Treasury paying out 1% when you can buy one from the government for 3.5%?

> Signature Bank, a New York-based regional bank that became a leader in cryptocurrency lending, shuttered suddenly on Sunday, marking the third-biggest bank failure in U.S. history just two days after the country’s second biggest failure, Silicon Valley Bank, rocked the stock market and reignited fears of “challenging and turbulent” economic times.
