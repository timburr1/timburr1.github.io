## Estimation
**Part I: The Big Line-Up**  
Each player takes a turn, in which they may do any one of the following actions:
* Place a new story card on the wall.
* Mover a previously placed story card. It is perfectly OK to slide cards down to make room for the repositioned card, so long as the ordering of the other cards is preserved.
* Pass the turn to the next player.

Cards are placed left to right, smallest to largest. It pays to space them widely so you can easily change the order later. Play continues until every player has passed.

**Part II: What's Your Number?**  
Each player takes a turn, in which they may do any one of the following actions:
* Place the next Fibonacci card above a story card, indicating where the next increase in story size occurs.
* Move a Fibonacci card to a different story. (The move must preserve the order of the number cards, i.e. one must come before two, 13 before 21...)
* Move a story card, just as in part one.
* Pass the turn to the next player.

Play continues until every player has passed, indicating that there are no more adjustments needed to the order of the stories, or the size assignments.
