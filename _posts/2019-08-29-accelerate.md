['Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations'](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=accelerate&qid=1567118731&s=gateway&sr=8-1)  
by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim  

**Continuous Delivery Capabilities**  
Use version control for all production artifacts (including application code, configurations, build/environment setup scripts, etc.)  
Automate the deployment process  
Implement [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)  
Use trunk-based development methods: fewer than about three active branches, short lifetimes (ideally less than a day)  
Implement test automation: tests should be fast, reliable, and automatic  
Support test data maintenance: as much as it takes to automate testing, but no more  
Shift left on security  
Implement continuous delivery  

**Architecture Capabilities**  
Use a loosely coupled architecture (!)  
Architect for empowered teams: let them choose their own tools as much as possible  

**Product and Process Capabilities**  
Gather and implement customer feedback  
Make the flow of work visible through the value stream: "Teams should have a good understanding of and visibility into the flow of work from the business all the way through the customers..."  
Work in small batches  
Foster and enable team experimentation  

**Lean Management and Monitoring Capabilities**  
Have a lightweight change approval process: peer review GOOD, external change approval boards BAD  
Monitor across application and infrastructure to inform business decisions  
Check system health proactively  
Improve processes and mange work with work-in-progress limits  
Visualize work to monitor quality and communicate throughout the team  

**Cultural Capabilities**  
Support a generative (i.e. Westrum) culture  
Encourage and support learning  
Support and facilitate collaboration among teams
Provide resources and tools that make work meaningful
Support or embody transformational leadership
